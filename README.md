# javascript-timed-quiz
This project is meant to showcase that I've learned how to intergrate javascript into css/html to add functionality to web pages.

## Deployment Link

## Description
For this challenge I took a basic template of a javascript quiz that I first discovered here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU&t=1758s. From this template I removed and added some functionalities to fit my assignment's purposes. I, for example, added a local storage functionality that would enable a user to save their top 10 scores to their computers. And I removed some functionalities that I deemed redudant such as a progress bar. I also heavily altered a lot of the styling elements found in the template.
Though the ui might not be the cleanest... I do want this project out of my way, it was the hardest by far.
